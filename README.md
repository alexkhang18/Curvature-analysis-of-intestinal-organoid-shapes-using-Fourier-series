# Curvature-analysis-of-intestinal-organoid-shapes-using-Fourier-series
This code takes in an intestinal organoid segmentation and constructs a Fourier series representation of the boundary. Curvature along the boundary representation is then computed and interpolated within the organoid body to attribute curvature values to regions inside the organoid.
